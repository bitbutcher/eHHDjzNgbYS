Payout(s)
---------
100% of all buy-ins and re-buys will be payed out.  Payouts will be calculated based on the following table:

| Players | Places        | Payout Percentages |
|:--------|:-------------:|:------------------:|
| 1-5     | 1st           | 100                |
| 6-8     | 1st, 2nd      | 70, 30             |
| 9-15    | 1st, 2nd, 3rd | 65, 25, 10         |

Payout amounts will be calculated from last payout position to first. Amounts will be rounded down to the nearest $5
increment and all remainders will flow into to the first place payout. An example  of 9 buy-ins and 4 re-buys at $25 is outlined below:

| Position | Amount   | Calculation
|:---------|:---------|:-----------:
| Purse    | $325     | ((9 + 4) * 25)
| Third    | $30      | (325 * 0.10)
| Second   | $80      | (325 * 0.25)
| First    | $215     | (325 - (80 + 30))
